# AWS Migration Hub - Real-Time Example

## Scenario: Migrating XYZ Corp.'s ERP System to AWS
XYZ Corp. operates an **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system** on-premises, which includes:
- ✅ A **web application** for inventory management.
- ✅ A **database server** storing product and customer data.
- ✅ A **reporting system** generating business insights.

Since maintaining on-premises infrastructure is costly and difficult to scale, XYZ Corp. decides to migrate to **AWS Cloud** with minimal downtime.

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Assess (Pre-Migration)
Before migration, XYZ Corp. must analyze its existing infrastructure using AWS discovery tools.

### **🔍 AWS Discovery Tools Used:**
1️⃣ **AWS Discovery Agent**
   - Installed on **each ERP server** (Application Server, Database Server).
   - **Collects CPU, memory, network usage, and dependencies.**

2️⃣ **AWS Discovery Connector (Evaluator Collector)**
   - Installed as a **virtual appliance** in VMware.
   - **Gathers metadata** about all virtual machines (VMs) in vCenter.
   - Does **NOT** collect deep performance data but provides an overview.

### **📌 Outcome:**
✅ Identifies **high CPU usage** on the database server.
✅ Detects **dependencies** between ERP components.
✅ Helps decide on **Rehost, Replatform, or Refactor** strategies.

---

## 🚀 Step 2: Mobilize (Planning & Preparation)
XYZ Corp. finalizes a migration strategy:
- **Web Application:** **Rehost** (Lift-and-Shift to AWS EC2).
- **Database Server:** **Replatform** (Upgrade to Amazon RDS).
- **Reporting System:** **Refactor** (Convert to AWS Lambda + S3).

### **📌 Outcome:**
✅ Defined migration strategy.
✅ Selected AWS services (EC2, RDS, Lambda, S3).
✅ Configured **AWS networking (VPC, Security Groups, IAM Roles).**

---

## 🚀 Step 3: Migrate & Track Progress
AWS Migration Hub is used to track the migration in real-time.

### **🔹 Web Application Migration (Rehost - Lift & Shift)**
- Uses **AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)** to migrate the web app to **EC2 instances**.
- **Migration Hub** tracks server replication and cutover progress.

### **🔹 Database Migration (Replatform - Lift & Optimize)**
- Uses **AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)** to migrate **SQL Server to Amazon RDS**.
- **Migration Hub** monitors database migration progress.

### **🔹 Reporting System Migration (Refactor - Modernization)**
- Migrates reporting system to **AWS Lambda** for serverless execution.
- Uses **Migration Hub Refactor Spaces** for incremental modernization.

### **📌 Outcome:**
✅ **Real-time tracking** of migration progress.
✅ **Zero data loss** during database migration.
✅ **Risk minimized** by migrating in **phases**.

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Validate & Optimize (Post-Migration)
Once migrated, XYZ Corp. verifies system functionality and optimizes resources.

### **🔹 Application Validation**
- Employees test the ERP system running on AWS.
- **AWS CloudWatch** monitors health metrics.

### **🔹 Performance Optimization**
- Right-sizing EC2 instances to optimize costs.
- Auto-scaling RDS database for better performance.

### **📌 Final Outcome:**
✅ XYZ Corp. **successfully migrated** to AWS.
✅ **Cost reduced by 40%** due to optimized cloud resources.
✅ **Improved scalability** with AWS-managed services.
