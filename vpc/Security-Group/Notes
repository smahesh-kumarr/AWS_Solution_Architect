# Security Groups - Mini Notes

This repository contains summarized notes on AWS Security Groups with real-world examples to help understand different use cases.

## Use Cases

### 1. Allow Specific IP Addresses
You can allow traffic from a specific IP or range using CIDR notation.

**Example**:
- Allow a single IP: `192.168.1.100/32`.
- Allow a subnet range: `192.168.1.0/24`.

### 2. Allow Traffic Between Security Groups
Security Groups can allow traffic between instances by referencing another Security Group as the source.

**Example**:
- Web servers in `sg-web-app` can connect to database servers in `sg-db` on port 3306 (MySQL).

### 3. Using Multiple Security Groups (Permissive Nature)
An instance can belong to multiple Security Groups. Rules are cumulative and permissive, meaning any rule that allows traffic will enable it unless explicitly denied.

**Example**:
- `sg-web` allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`).
- `sg-admin` allows SSH only from a specific IP (`192.168.1.100/32`).
- Both Security Groups combined allow public web access and restricted SSH.

## Notes
- Security Groups are stateful: return traffic is automatically allowed.
- Security Groups do not support explicit deny rules, unlike Network ACLs.

### 
- You can have up to 10,000 Security Groups in a Region (default is 2,500)
- You can have 60 inbound rules and 60 outbound rules per security group
- 16 Security Groups per Elastic Network Interface (ENI) (default is 5)

- Security groups do not filter traffic destined to and from the following:
- Amazon Domain Name Services (DNS)
- Amazon Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- Amazon EC2 instance metadata
- Amazon ECS task metadata endpoints
- License activation for Windows instances
