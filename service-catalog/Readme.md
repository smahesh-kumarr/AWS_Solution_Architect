# **AWS Service Catalog Constraints - Detailed Explanation**  

## **What Are Constraints in AWS Service Catalog?**
Constraints in **AWS Service Catalog** help enforce security, governance, and compliance when deploying products within a portfolio. They control **how** users launch and manage products while preventing unauthorized modifications.

# **\ud83d\udccc Types of Constraints in AWS Service Catalog**  

| Constraint Type             | Description | Key Benefit |
|----------------------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Launch Constraint**      | Defines an **IAM role** that users must assume to launch a product. | Controls permissions for launching products. |
| **Stack Set Constraint**   | Ensures that a product is deployed across **multiple AWS accounts or regions** using AWS CloudFormation StackSets. | Enables multi-account and multi-region deployments. |
| **Resource Update Constraint** | Prevents users from updating certain product settings **after deployment**. | Ensures product consistency and compliance. |
| **Template Constraint**    | Restricts input parameters for CloudFormation templates (e.g., limiting instance types, VPCs). | Enforces best practices and cost control. |
| **Tag Update Constraint**  | Controls whether users can update **tags** on provisioned products after launch. | Maintains cost allocation and resource tracking. |
| **Notification Constraint** | Sends **SNS notifications** whenever a product is launched or updated. | Enables monitoring and event-driven automation. |

# **\ud83d\udcdd Detailed Explanation of Each Constraint with Examples**  

## **1\ufe0f\u20e3 Launch Constraint**
**Purpose**: Defines the **IAM role** that users must assume when launching a product.  
\u2705 **Prevents unauthorized users from launching resources with unrestricted permissions.**

### **Example**
A company wants developers to launch **EC2 instances** but only through a **restricted IAM role**.  

### **How to Apply Launch Constraint**
1. Go to **AWS Service Catalog** \u2192 **Portfolios** \u2192 Select Portfolio.  
2. Click **Constraints** \u2192 **Add Constraint** \u2192 Select **Launch Constraint**.  
3. Assign an **IAM role** that defines the permissions for the product launch.

### **Outcome**
- Users can **launch EC2 instances** only if they assume the assigned IAM role.
- Prevents users from **escalating privileges or misconfiguring resources**.

## **2\ufe0f\u20e3 Stack Set Constraint**
**Purpose**: Ensures that a product is deployed **across multiple AWS accounts or regions** using **AWS CloudFormation StackSets**.  
\u2705 **Useful for enterprises managing deployments in multiple AWS accounts.**

### **Example**
An organization wants to deploy an **Amazon S3 bucket** with the same security policies across **all business units (AWS accounts)**.

### **How to Apply Stack Set Constraint**
1. Go to **Portfolios** \u2192 Select Portfolio \u2192 **Constraints**.  
2. Click **Add Constraint** \u2192 Select **Stack Set Constraint**.  
3. Define target AWS **accounts and regions** where the product should be deployed.

### **Outcome**
- Automatically provisions the S3 bucket **in all specified AWS accounts**.
- Ensures **consistent configurations and security policies** across environments.

---

## **3\ufe0f\u20e3 Resource Update Constraint**
**Purpose**: Prevents users from **modifying a provisioned product** after launch.  
\u2705 **Useful for enforcing compliance in IT environments.**

### **Example**
A company provides **RDS databases** to developers, but does not want them to change the database instance type after provisioning.

### **How to Apply Resource Update Constraint**
1. Go to **Portfolios** \u2192 Select Portfolio \u2192 **Constraints**.  
2. Click **Add Constraint** \u2192 Select **Resource Update Constraint**.  
3. Set **restrictions on parameters** (e.g., instance type, storage, VPC settings).

### **Outcome**
- Developers **cannot modify** the RDS instance type after launch.
- Prevents **accidental cost overruns** and security misconfigurations.

---

## **4\ufe0f\u20e3 Template Constraint**
**Purpose**: Restricts **input parameters** in CloudFormation templates to enforce **best practices, security, and cost control**.  
\u2705 **Prevents users from selecting non-approved configurations (e.g., expensive EC2 instances).**

### **Example**
A company allows developers to launch EC2 instances **only of type `t3.micro`** to control costs.

### **How to Apply Template Constraint**
1. Go to **Portfolios** \u2192 Select Portfolio \u2192 **Constraints**.  
2. Click **Add Constraint** \u2192 Select **Template Constraint**.  
3. Define **allowed values** for specific parameters (e.g., `InstanceType = t3.micro`).

### **Outcome**
- Developers **cannot launch EC2 instances** larger than `t3.micro`.
- Ensures **cost efficiency and compliance with company policies**.

---

## **5\ufe0f\u20e3 Tag Update Constraint**
**Purpose**: Controls whether users can **modify tags** on a provisioned product.  
\u2705 **Ensures proper tracking of resources for billing and compliance.**

### **Example**
A company requires that all AWS resources have a **"Project" tag** but does not want users to modify it after launch.

### **How to Apply Tag Update Constraint**
1. Go to **Portfolios** \u2192 Select Portfolio \u2192 **Constraints**.  
2. Click **Add Constraint** \u2192 Select **Tag Update Constraint**.  
3. Set rules **restricting tag modifications**.

### **Outcome**
- Users cannot modify or remove mandatory tags (e.g., `"Project: Finance"`).
- Ensures accurate **cost allocation and tracking**.

---

## **6\ufe0f\u20e3 Notification Constraint**
**Purpose**: Sends **SNS notifications** whenever a product is launched or updated.  
\u2705 **Useful for monitoring and automation workflows.**

### **Example**
A company wants an **IT administrator** to receive an email notification every time a new **EC2 instance** is launched.

### **How to Apply Notification Constraint**
1. Create an **SNS Topic** and subscribe admins to receive notifications.  
2. Go to **Portfolios** \u2192 Select Portfolio \u2192 **Constraints**.  
3. Click **Add Constraint** \u2192 Select **Notification Constraint**.  
4. Provide the **SNS topic ARN**.

### **Outcome**
- The IT administrator **receives an email notification** whenever a new EC2 instance is launched.
- Enables **event-driven automation** (e.g., trigger security scans when a new product is provisioned).
